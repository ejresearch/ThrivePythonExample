Per my client’s request, I am unable to share the actual questioners I developed for Thrive360, however, the samples I generated were developed by using mental health support video transcripts and querying them to generate synthetic data; post session questions used to maximize the impact of the company’s material. This front and backend website aims to demonstrate how I have leveraged advancing technology to expand my skillsets and host my questioners. 

My listed reference, Christy Lamka, is more than happy to speak to my contributions to her team. I am excited to provide the scope of the research I am collaborating on and would be happy to clarify questions the Anthropic might have during the interview process!
